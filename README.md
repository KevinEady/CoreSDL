# CoreSDL
These bindings are as close as the C version as possible data-wise, but use all the C# conventions for naming. Nothing is marshalled or converted behind your back. However, a Utf8 class is provided to convert byte pointers to and from string as fast as possible. Everything else is completely unmanaged.
